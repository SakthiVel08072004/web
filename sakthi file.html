        <h2><u>The Lion and the Rabbit:</u></h2>      
        <p><pre><strong><h3>         One day, there was a lion who came to a forest. He was big and strong and therefore used to hunt down two to three animals for his food.<br>One day, all the animals came up to the lion and told him that each day one of them will come to him for his means, and therefore, he does not have <br>to kill so many animals at once.As promised, everyday one animal used to reach to the lion and the lion would prey on them. On one fine day, a very <br>clever rabbit was walking down the path to reach the lion when he suddenly saw a well and planned to kill the lion. As he went to the lion, he told him <br>that there is another lion who claims to be more powerful than him.Listening to that, the lion became very angry and ordered the rabbit to take him to <br>the other lion. Listening to this, the rabbit cleverly took the lion near the well and told him that the lion lives inside the well. As the lion peeped <br>into the well,he saw his own reflection and thought that it was the other lion and jumped into the well and died. </p></pre></strong></h3>
